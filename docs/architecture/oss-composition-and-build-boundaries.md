# OSS composition and build boundaries

This document records what `bowline` uses from open source, what it only
studies, and what it must build itself.

## Decision: Do not adopt an existing OSS project wholesale

There is no open-source project that can become `bowline` without bending the
product thesis. The closest projects solve important slices, but not the whole
workspace promise.

The product promise is:

```text
Your ~/Code tree exists everywhere as a real directory, syncs source/config/env,
understands dev junk, carries project env, and gives every agent a fresh
workspace.
```

That requires a custom workspace graph, policy model, trust/status surface,
project env sync model, hydration semantics, and agent lease runtime.

Use open source aggressively for plumbing. Do not let a plumbing project become
the product model.

## Public source boundary

The public repository is an allowlisted client/core source export from the
private canonical repo. It exists so developers can inspect the CLI, daemon,
local sync engine, storage substrate, contracts, safe tests, and trust-boundary
documentation.

The export does not make the public repo canonical, does not publish prerelease
agent instructions, and does not imply self-hosting or open-ended contribution
support. Runtime and package deployment channels such as Convex, Cloudflare,
crates.io, npm, release assets, and app distribution remain separate release
work.

## Build ourselves

These are product semantics, not replaceable libraries.

- Workspace graph and namespace authority.
- Source-of-truth split across workspace graph, encrypted CAS, generated/local
  state, secrets, and agent overlays.
- Path conflict rules and project identity model.
- Workspace event model and ref semantics.
- Dev-aware policy compiler with modes like `workspace-sync`,
  `local-regenerate`, `local-cache`, `project-env`, `agent-readable`, and
  `agent-hidden`.
- Scanner and classifier for existing `~/Code` folders.
- Trust/status UX that explains what syncs, what stays local, what is stale,
  what is secret, and what is degraded.
- Materialization semantics: source/config/env/opaque Git bytes become real
  local files quickly; generated/dependency/cache state stays local-regenerate
  or local-cache; large files can remain lazy by policy.
- Setup recipes, setup receipts, and local regeneration so generated folders
  stay local without making users rerun setup manually.
- Agent lease model with fresh base, write scope, hydration budget, inherited
  project env by default, expiry, audit log, output target, and cleanup state.
- Agent-native contract: structured context, primitive tools, prompt recipes,
  event-backed status, capability discovery, and lifecycle verbs.
- Project env sync, conflict handling, and `.env` materialization.
- Conflict model: no last-writer-wins for code, file conflicts keep both, and
  secrets stay versioned and audited.
- Conflict repair TUI that detects installed agent CLIs from `PATH`, creates a
  structured conflict bundle, and always offers a copy-prompt fallback.
- macOS Menu Bar Status App that reports event-backed status, can complete
  pending device approval after explicit confirmation, and leaves repair
  workflow actions to CLI/TUI.
- Device trust flow with pending approval requests, encrypted device grants,
  delegated device approval, generated Recovery Keys, and no default server-side
  key escrow.
- Workspace-wide device trust for approved devices. Agent leases scope agent
  behavior; device grants are not project-scoped by default.
- Remote bootstrap over explicit SSH for installing, registering, approving,
  verifying, and handing off to agents on Linux hosts.
- Merge test scenarios for rename-plus-edit, delete-versus-edit, case-only path
  collisions, structured-text parser failures, `.env` per-key merges, and
  conflict-span edits.

## Build order

The first implementation path proves the product with a real-directory sync
engine on the v1 path. The daemon and status spine come first internally, but
the product proof is not complete until `~/Code` is an ordinary synced directory
that tools can use without wrapper commands.

1. Build `bowline login --root ~/Code` and `bowline status` first. Existing
   roots are read-only during init; requested missing roots are created as the
   happy path.
2. Detect developer files, generated folders, env files, setup receipts,
   duplicate paths, and explicit local-only projects.
3. Pass the Convex/R2/Rust spike gate: authenticate from Rust, create and
   approve a device, upload an encrypted blob directly to R2, commit metadata
   and advance a ref in Convex, observe the event from a second Rust process,
   download from R2, verify the BLAKE3 hash, and prove stale-ref handling with
   two racing writers.
4. Add workspace refs, device login, device approval requests, delegated device
   approval, encrypted device grants, generated Recovery Keys, and daemon-owned
   real-root sync so a project appears as real files on a second machine.
5. Add the policy compiler, encrypted CAS for workspace-sync files, and local
   dependency regeneration.
6. Add `.bowlinesetup`, setup receipts, and lockfile-backed inference so
   `cd ~/Code/foo && pnpm dev` works on a second machine.
7. Add event-backed status and JSON-first `bowline status`, `bowline explain`,
   `bowline approve`, and `bowline status --watch`. The macOS Menu Bar Status
   App can land here as an ambient consumer of that status stream with narrow
   pending device approval, and Linux desktop notifications can use
   `notify-rust` where available.
8. Add `bowline connect` for agent-native Linux host setup over explicit SSH.
9. Add conflict records, conflict bundles, and `bowline resolve` with agent CLI
   detection and copy-prompt fallback.
10. Add the agent-native contract: `AgentContextV1`, primitive tools, capability
    discovery, prompt recipes, and lifecycle verbs.
11. Add agent leases with direct project writes by default, optional isolated
    overlays, and inherited project env.
12. Add index-backed search and symbol lookup before broad hydration.
13. Harden real-root sync, distribution, guided permissions, recovery, Finder
    Sync badges, and filesystem workload coverage.
14. Build a merge test corpus that exercises the file identity confidence ladder
    and conflict-span behavior before broader testing.

## Anti-goals

Do not turn `bowline` into any of these:

- a Syncthing or Mutagen fork
- a JuiceFS or object-store filesystem wrapper
- an EdenFS or VFS-for-Git clone
- a Kopia or git-annex UI
- a jj wrapper
- a Radicle competitor
- a Coder or devcontainer manager

Those projects can save implementation time at the edges. They cannot define the
product boundary.
